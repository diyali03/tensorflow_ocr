# Tensorflow_ocr
Using tensorflow on chinese OCR


### Install tensorflow on Linux
Install by anaconda
Fixed the command error
`export PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH`

Environment: Ubuntu 16+; Python 3.6; Tensorflow-CPU

Finished testing Tensorflow OCR by SpikeFlow; recognition result even lower than tesseract. Plus, Spike using openCV to train single word. It is not worth to do that.
